## üìÅ About the Dataset

This dataset is provided by IBM as part of its sample data sets for data science practice. It is aimed at predicting customer churn ‚Äî identifying customers who are likely to leave the telecom service.

> **Context:**  
> "Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." ‚Äî IBM Sample Data Sets

## üßæ Dataset Content

Each row represents a unique customer. Each column provides information about the customer's demographic, services signed up for, account status, and whether or not they have churned.

### üîç Key Features:

- **Churn Information:**
  - `Churn`: Indicates whether the customer left the company in the last month.

- **Services Signed Up:**
  - `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`
  - `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`, `TechSupport`
  - `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies`

- **Account Information:**
  - `tenure`: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
  - `Contract`: Type of contract (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
  - `PaymentMethod`: Method used for payment.
  - `PaperlessBilling`: Whether the customer uses paperless billing.
  - `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`: Monthly and total charges.

- **Demographic Information:**
  - `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`

- **Customer ID:**
  - `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
